iXhash2.pm is a plugin for SpamAssassin 3.2.0 and up. It takes the body of a
mail, strips parts from it and then computes a hash value from the rest. 
These values will then be looked up via DNS to see if the hashes have
already been categorized as spam by others.

This plugin is based on parts of the procmail-based project 'NiX Spam',
developed by Bert Ungerer.(un@ix.de) For more information see
http://www.heise.de/ix/nixspam/.  The procmail code producing the hashes
only can be found here: ftp://ftp.ix.de/pub/ix/ix_listings/2004/05/checksums

iXhash2 is an unofficial version based on iXhash version 1.5.5
(http://www.ixhash.net), adding async DNS lookups for performance and
removing unneeded features.  It's fully compatible with the existing
implementation.
