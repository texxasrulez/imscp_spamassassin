## Make SpamAssassin user preferences interface available through control panel

Providing SA user preference interface trough Roundcube plugin goes against our
freedom policy. An administrator should not be forced to install Roundcube for
providing his users with SA user preference interface. The SA user preferences
should be settable whatever the Webmail in use or even when the administrator
decided to not install any Webmail.

The TxRep plugin comes as an enhancement and replacement for the AWL plugin. It is available in SA â‰¥ 3.4.1
